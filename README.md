FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. Here are the main concepts or topics that you should understand to build production-ready applications with FastAPI:

1. **Python 3.6+ and Type Hints**: Before diving into FastAPI, you need to be familiar with Python, especially version 3.6 and later, and Python's type hints. Type hints are a new syntax (since Python 3.5) that allow for indicating the type of a value within your Python code. FastAPI uses these type hints to do a lot of "behind the scenes" work, reducing the amount of code you need to write and debug.

2. **ASGI**: ASGI stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface and is the standard for Python asynchronous web apps and servers. FastAPI is an ASGI web framework, which means it is designed with asynchronous and non-blocking code in mind. Understanding ASGI can help you better understand how your FastAPI applications work.

3. **Path Parameters and Query Strings**: FastAPI provides simple ways to define the paths in your API and to access parameters from the path or from the query string. This involves understanding how to define API routes, how to accept parameters in these routes, and how these parameters can be typed and validated.

4. **Request Body**: FastAPI makes it easy to accept JSON data in the request body, and it can automatically validate this data and give helpful error messages using the type hints that you provide. This involves understanding Python's Pydantic library, which FastAPI uses extensively.

5. **Response Model**: FastAPI can automatically generate interactive API documentation (with Swagger UI and ReDoc) from your code, and a big part of this comes from defining your response models. This involves understanding how to use Pydantic models to define your API's responses.

6. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's dependency injection system is a key feature that can simplify your code and improve its reusability and testability. This involves understanding how to define dependencies using Python's type hints, and how to inject these dependencies into your routes.

7. **Security and Authentication**: FastAPI provides several tools to assist with API security, including support for OAuth2 with JWT tokens and HTTP Basic Auth. This involves understanding the basics of API security, as well as how to use FastAPI's security classes to protect your routes.

8. **Testing**: FastAPI is designed to be easy to test with the Pytest library, and understanding how to write unit tests for your FastAPI apps will be a key part of creating production-ready applications.

9. **Database Interaction**: Although FastAPI doesn't dictate how you should interact with your database, it's common to use an async ORM like SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM with FastAPI. Understanding how to interact with a database in an async context will be a crucial part of most FastAPI apps.

10. **Deploying FastAPI Applications**: Deploying a FastAPI application requires understanding of ASGI servers, such as Uvicorn or Hypercorn, and containers like Docker can also be very useful. You'll need to learn how to serve your FastAPI app with an ASGI server, and how to deploy this server in a production setting.

Remember that each of these topics is quite deep, and you should take your time to understand each one. Start with simple examples and gradually move on to more complex applications as you become more comfortable with FastAPI.
